**Functional Test Cases:**

1. Test Case: Verify the application starts successfully
   - Input: Start the application
   - Expected Output: Application starts without any errors and displays the appropriate welcome message

2. Test Case: Verify the REST API endpoint for retrieving all data
   - Input: Send a GET request to /api/data
   - Expected Output: A list of all data objects is returned with a 200 OK status

3. Test Case: Verify the REST API endpoint for retrieving data by ID
   - Input: Send a GET request to /api/data/{id} with a valid ID
   - Expected Output: The data object with the specified ID is returned with a 200 OK status
   - Edge Case: Send a GET request with an invalid ID, expect a 404 Not Found status

4. Test Case: Verify the REST API endpoint for creating new data
   - Input: Send a POST request to /api/data with a valid data object
   - Expected Output: The new data object is created and returned with a 201 Created status
   - Edge Case: Send a POST request with an invalid data object, expect a 400 Bad Request status

5. Test Case: Verify the REST API endpoint for updating existing data
   - Input: Send a PUT request to /api/data/{id} with a valid ID and updated data object
   - Expected Output: The data object is updated and returned with a 200 OK status
   - Edge Case: Send a PUT request with an invalid ID or data object, expect a 400 Bad Request status

6. Test Case: Verify the REST API endpoint for deleting data by ID
   - Input: Send a DELETE request to /api/data/{id} with a valid ID
   - Expected Output: The data object with the specified ID is deleted and a 200 OK status is returned
   - Edge Case: Send a DELETE request with an invalid ID, expect a 404 Not Found status

**Non-Functional Test Cases:**

1. Test Case: Verify the application's response time for each API endpoint
   - Input: Send requests to each API endpoint
   - Expected Output: The response time for each endpoint should be within the acceptable range as per the performance requirements

2. Test Case: Verify the application's scalability under high load
   - Input: Simulate high load conditions on the application
   - Expected Output: The application should be able to handle the high load without significant performance degradation

3. Test Case: Verify the application's security against common vulnerabilities
   - Input: Perform security testing using tools like OWASP ZAP or similar
   - Expected Output: The application should not have any critical security vulnerabilities

4. Test Case: Verify the application's error handling and logging
   - Input: Trigger errors by sending invalid requests or causing exceptions
   - Expected Output: The application should log the errors and return meaningful error messages to the client
