   - Input: Task Name, Deadline
   - Expected Output: Task created successfully, Task added to the list
   - Edge Cases:
       - Empty Task Name
       - Invalid Deadline format

2. Set Deadline
   - Input: Task ID, New Deadline
   - Expected Output: Task deadline updated
   - Edge Cases:
       - Invalid Task ID
       - Invalid Deadline format

3. Mark Task as Complete
   - Input: Task ID
   - Expected Output: Task marked as complete, Task status updated
   - Edge Cases:
       - Invalid Task ID

4. Delete Task
   - Input: Task ID
   - Expected Output: Task deleted, Task removed from the list
   - Edge Cases:
       - Invalid Task ID

5. Display Tasks
   - Input: None
   - Expected Output: List of tasks displayed, sorted by deadline
   - Edge Cases:
       - No tasks available

Non-Functional Test Cases:

1. Performance
   - Test the application's response time when handling a large number of tasks
   - Test the application's ability to handle multiple user requests concurrently

2. Usability
   - Test the user interface for ease of use and understandability
   - Test the application's error messages for clarity and helpfulness

3. Security
   - Test the application's ability to prevent unauthorized access to user data
   - Test the application's ability to prevent SQL injection and other common security vulnerabilities

4. Compatibility
   - Test the application's compatibility with different operating systems and Java versions
   - Test the application's compatibility with different screen resolutions and devices

5. Scalability
   - Test the application's ability to handle an increasing number of tasks and users without compromising performance or functionality
